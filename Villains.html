            <h2>The Toad Menace</h2>
            <p>In the kingdom of Afrogtasia, ruled by the benevolent King Frogalishious, a dark threat looms on the horizon. The toads, vile and treacherous, have invaded our peaceful lands, bringing chaos and destruction. The Blue Fogs Protectors Guild is here to expose their wicked deeds and defend our kingdom!</p>

            <h3>Why We Must Stop the Toads</h3>
            <p>The toads are not just an annoyanceâ€”they are a significant threat to the way of life in Afrogtasia. Here are some reasons why we must stop them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Toads spread fear and panic among our citizens.</li>
                <li>They destroy our crops and homes.</li>
                <li>Their presence disrupts the harmony of Afrogtasia.</li>
                <li>They pose a direct threat to King Frogalishious's reign.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who is this new menace?</h3>
            <p>The toads are not too dissimilar to the frog nations as we are both amphibians although there are many differences.</p>

            <p>There is a story passed from generations within the royal family. It tells the tale of 2 siblings who founded the 2 nations.</p>
			<article class="item">
            <p>Felix, with his sleek, streamlined body and long, powerful legs, epitomized the classic image of a frog. His smooth, moist skin shimmered in the moonlight, reflecting the colours of the rainbow like a prism in a sun shower. His webbed feet were like miniature oars, propelling him effortlessly through the water with each graceful leap. And oh, how he loved to leap, his jumps reaching heights that seemed to defy gravity itself.
Tilda, on the other hand, was a toad of a different stripe. Her body was squat and stout, her skin rough and warty, like a gnarled old tree trunk. Her short legs were built for hopping, but lacked the elegance and finesse of her brother's. Instead of webbed feet, she had sturdy toes adorned with thick pads, perfect for gripping onto slippery rocks and muddy banks. And while Felix's skin glistened with moisture, Tilda's was dry and textured, like sandpaper under the sun.</p>
<p>Their bond was as sticky as frog slime, until one fateful day when a dispute over a particularly plump fly set off a chain of absurd events.
It started innocently enough. Felix, with his keen eyes and agile tongue, spotted the plump insect first. But Tilda, with her stout legs and lightning reflexes, snatched it up before Felix could even blink. What ensued was a comical tug-of-war, with the fly being pulled in all directions, its buzz drowned out by the siblings' squabbling.
In the chaos of their dispute, they failed to notice the mischievous magpie perched on a nearby branch, observing with keen interest. With a cackle that echoed through the swamp, the magpie swooped down and snatched the fly right out of their grasp.</p>
<p>Felix and Tilda, momentarily stunned by the bird's audacity, turned their accusatory gazes upon each other. The blame game began, each accusing the other of being too slow, too greedy, or simply too foolish.
What started as a petty squabble soon escalated into a full-blown feud. They sabotaged each other's hunting grounds, leaving fake flies and slimy traps. They played pranks that would make even the most mischievous pixie blush, turning lily pads into trampolines and swamp gas into perfumes.
Their rivalry became the stuff of legend in the swamp, with critters gathering around to watch their antics like a particularly bizarre soap opera. But beneath the absurdity, there lay a seed of sadness, for deep down, Felix and Tilda still loved each other, even if they couldn't quite remember why.</p>

<p>And so, the tale of Felix the Frog and Tilda the Toad, once inseparable siblings, ended not with a ribbit or a croak, but with a whispered sigh and a lingering sense of what could have been.</p>
